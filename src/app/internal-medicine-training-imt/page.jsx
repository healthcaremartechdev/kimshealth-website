                                            <h2>IMT Program at KIMSHEALTH Trivandrum</h2>
                                            <p>KIMSHEALTH, a known brand for quality healthcare delivery in India and in the GCC, has its flagship hospital in
                                                Trivandrum, Kerala. It is an 850-bed multi-specialty quaternary care facility, which has emerged as one of the leading
                                                Research and Academic Centres in South India, with a global outreach. KIMSHEALTH has covetable national and i
                                                nternational accreditations like NABH & ACHSI.</p>
                                            <p>KIMSHEALTH has joined hands with the Federation of Royal College of Physicians (RCP) which comprises the RCPs of
                                                Edinburgh, Glasgow, and London to conduct the unique Internal Medicine Training program (IMT) earlier termed as Core Medical Training (CMT) a three-year residency program for training and educating aspiring MRCP candidates to ensure success and matching the high standards as in the UK.</p>
                                            <p>The MRCP conducted by the RCP is getting more and more popular in India and many medical graduates from India fail the MRCP examination purely because of lack of training. Therefore, KIMSHEALTH aims to extend a structured teaching program which promises to provide the much-needed training for candidates by faculties who have extensive teaching experience and knowledge in MRCP. KIMSHEALTH also wants to cultivate the clinical approach of IMT training to improve patient care.</p>
                                            <p>IMT curriculum will provide physicians with the required skills. The Trainees have to complete the full IMT program including workplace-based assessments and their MRCP (UK) examinations during this period. The MRCP (UK) Part 3 Clinical
                                                Examination (Practical Assessment of Clinical Examination Skills) â€“ PACES examination is held in Kochi, Trivandrum and other sites in India. The MRCP (UK) PACES exam is designed to test the clinical knowledge and skills of Trainee Doctors who hope to enter higher specialty training in UK. Trainees must have passed the Part 1 written examination within the last 7 years before taking PACES. The exam sets rigorous standards to ensure that Trainees are competent across a range of skills and ready to provide a high standard of care to patients. In PACES, candidates are assessed on their ability to carry out essential clinical skills. Candidates undergoing IMT in KIMSHEALTH are considered equivalent to those completing the program in the UK and have an equal chance to proceed for higher specialty training in the UK (PLAB exempted). The first IMT program at KIMSHEALTH commenced in November 2018.</p>
